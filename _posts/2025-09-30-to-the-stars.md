I don't know you  
yet I know one thing:  
you are the thing  
that feels me in the dark,  
to reach the dark.  
  
You come to me  
when I look up to you  
my eyes fill with tears   
you give me the emotion...indescribable  
  
This is the only reason,  
why I feel alive.  

  
I know  
you are the dark  
but you contain all emotions, colors, lights within you  

You are the most beautiful thing,  
The only truth I see...
