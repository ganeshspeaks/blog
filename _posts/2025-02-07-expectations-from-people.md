Expectations from People
Let’s be honest—we all expect people to treat us well, appreciate our efforts, and be kind to us. But reality? Most people act in their own self-interest, not because they’re bad, but because that’s just how human nature works.

So, if you’re constantly feeling disappointed because someone didn’t meet your expectations, maybe it’s time to stop expecting and start focusing on yourself. The less you rely on others for happiness, the more peace you’ll find.
