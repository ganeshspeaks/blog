For days now, I've been trying to post regularly on LinkedIn because, as people say, you should build a personal brand and all that. But today I realized - wait, why am I even doing this? 

**My goal is simple**: build Study Friend into a sustainable, profitable app making $1k MRR. I already know what works (blogs, educational YouTube videos, and SEO). These are things I actually enjoy and that bring real users. I don't need LinkedIn, Instagram, or any social media hustle. I don't need to be famous or post daily. I just need 50-100 students who find Study Friend valuable enough to pay for it. 

Every time I open LinkedIn and feel like I'm "supposed to" do something, I need to remember: those posts aren't bringing me users, they're just making me anxious and distracted. Dhananjay warned me about this: *getting excited by internet noise and losing focus*. 

Last year, I wasted time chasing unrealistic dreams. Not again. I know my path: write helpful content, build a great product, stay focused. Everything else is just noise. 
Keep going.
