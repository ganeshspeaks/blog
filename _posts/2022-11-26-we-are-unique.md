## We're Unique

> We are players, but not of same game.  <br/>
> We climb a tree, but we are not monkey.  <br/>
> We try to swim, but we are not fish. <br/>
> We are different players, but we play the same game. <br/>
> We are unique, but we want to achieve same things. <br/>
> This is because of our surroundings. <br/>
> People say do that, because everyone is doing so. <br/>
> But why they don't think, Fish doesn't need to climb a tree, <br/>
> And bird doesn't have to dive into the water. <br/>
> We are special, That's why we must choose our special goals. <br/>
