## We're Unique

*We are players, but not of same game.*
*We climb a tree, but we are not monkey.*
*We try to swim, but we are not fish.*
*We are different players, but we play the same game.*
*We are unique, but we want to achieve same things.*
*This is because of our surroundings.*
*People say do that, because everyone is doing so.*
*But why they don't think, Fish doesn't need to climb a tree,*
*And bird doesn't have to dive into the water.*
*We are special, That's why we must choose our special goals.*
