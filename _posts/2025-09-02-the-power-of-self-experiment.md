Last month, I committed to reading one book per day. Bold? Yes. Sustainable? Absolutely not.

Today, I realized something powerful: **The ability to experiment on yourself and quickly course-correct is the ultimate entrepreneurial skill.**

## What I Learned

**Setting ambitious experiments** teaches you your limits faster than playing it safe. I discovered that consuming 365 books wasn't helping me build better products, but it was just intellectual hoarding.

**Quick recognition** of what doesn't work is more valuable than stubbornly sticking to a plan. Most people continue bad habits because they're afraid to admit they were wrong.

**Course correction without ego** is rare. I'm not embarrassed that the book-a-day challenge didn't work. I'm proud I recognized it and pivoted.

## The Real Insight

**Execution beats consumption every time.** Instead of reading about business, I'm building one. Instead of studying success stories, I'm creating my own.

**This same experimental mindset applies to everything:**
- Product features (ship fast, kill what doesn't work)
- Marketing strategies (test, measure, pivot)
- Business models (validate quickly, adjust)

## Moving Forward

With 485 days to build a company, every decision matters. Every experiment teaches. Every pivot gets me closer to the goal.

The book challenge failed, but it taught me something more valuable: **I can trust myself to recognize when something isn't working and change course quickly.**

That's the skill that builds empires.
