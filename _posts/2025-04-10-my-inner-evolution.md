People treated me badly.  
They bullied me, ignored me, rejected me.  
At that time, I felt like harming them back. I used to feel angry, cold, disconnected.  
But somehow, even after hurting, I felt more pain inside.

So I started questioning.  
“Why am I like this?”  
“Why do they act like that?”  
“Why do I feel this much pain when I hurt back?”

And slowly… I began observing.  
Not them.  
**Myself.**  
My thoughts. My reactions. My desires. My inner world.

That’s when things changed.

I didn’t find answers in books or people. I found it through *watching* my own mind.  
I started seeing how even the smallest creature wants to live — the ants, the mosquitoes, the plants, the trees.

I started caring.  
Then loving.  
Then feeling satisfied — like really, deeply fulfilled — just by being compassionate.

I stopped killing anything.  
I turned vegetarian.  
Whenever I cut a tree or a plant to feed myself, I say sorry to the universe and the beings that depended on that tree.  
Not because I read it somewhere — but because **I feel it**.

I started experimenting more with compassion.  
How it changes me.  
How it creates peace.  
How it makes me feel like I belong to the whole universe — not separate from it.

This is not some philosophy I read.  
This is who I became — step by step, pain by pain, observation by observation.

I didn’t escape darkness.  
I observed it.  
And through that, I *transformed*.

Now, I walk as someone who may have once wanted to harm…  
but now protects even the tiniest life.

That’s my story.  
And I’m still writing it — every single day.
