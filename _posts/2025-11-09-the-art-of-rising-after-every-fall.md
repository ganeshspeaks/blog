![The Art of Rising After Every Fall](/images/blogs/one_door_closes_another_opens.jpg)

Life hits hard when we fail. We start feeling as if there’s no hope left. Even though we were giving our best with full energy and optimism, it suddenly seems like life has nothing more to offer, and we feel like giving up.

But we should always remember: "when one door closes, another opens." This has happened to us many times before: we thought everything was over, but later we forgot those painful moments as if they never existed.

Life is multifaceted, and ups and downs are absolutely normal.

So, never give up. Keep moving forward with a smile, because life is too short to dwell on the bad moments. There aren’t just one or two happy doors, "there are millions", but we can only see them when we are calm, not anxious or negative.
