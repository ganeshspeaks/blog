It has been months of grinding and hustling to make at least one successful startup or product. I tried mobile apps (Study Friend), later I realized that I needed a web app and when I developed StudyFriend.me, I failed in user retention. Users came, signed up, and never came back like it never happened.

Then, I thought I should develop something else in my life. I started developing a search engine. Literally... fuck off to me. I developed the search engine app (in Flutter), a crawler using Scrapy and Playwright (Python libraries), an indexer, and article-to-vector and query-to-vector embedding converters for vector search. I used Supabase (PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for vector search). After 10 days, I burned out. (I managed to index around 300+ popular government sites, some education sites, etc.)

These things happen to me mutliple times, I start something, I build that fully (most of the time), then I burn out, and lately switch the project.

After this stupidity, I decided to get into a job in October 2025, I went through 300-400+jobs posts, and applied for many. I saw that 99% were not hiring freshers, they were hiring senior devs with one decade of experience. One-two replied. One recruiter gave me interview assessment. So, I dedicated myself fully, and did the assessment. After submission, I got a response, and that response was auto-generated. And I realized that interview assessment and whole things were only for fun by them. I tried contacting them, no response, nothing. That startup was backed by YC, and had funding, it wasn't any random startup.

Currently, in November, I am trying to figure out what to do next, and what should be my next move.
