## Lessons

- Take 100% responsibility of your work, current situation, laziness, unhappy, and procrastination.
- Never hate or love your mistakes. If you hate them, you will be fearful of them, and if you love, then you will make same mistakes again and again, because we tend to repeat what we love.
- Keep your attention focused entirely on what is truly your concern and be clear that what belongs to others is their business and none of yours. - Epictetus
- Nobody is coming to save you. Never depend on anyone.
- Nothing is going to happen; you must make it happen.
- Whenever you’re trying to do something new, always try to keep it as simple as possible.
- “Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had…if you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow." -Jeff Bezos
- A goal that can’t be measured and has no time duration is not a goal. You’re just expecting a miracle to happen.
- “The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.” - Mark Zuckerberg
- “We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.” – Jim Rohn
- You must look in both directions: present and future. You must enjoy the present but not at the cost of your future. By being lazy, you don’t enjoy both your present and future.
- Stop looking for hacks before you even begin. First, start and then learn about various methods to do things faster.
- Done is better than perfect.
- “Mediocrity doesn’t just happen. It’s chosen over time through small choices day by day.” –Todd Henry
- “Your work will fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly
satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do
great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.
- Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” -Steve Jobs
- Think big. Even if you fail, that will still be better than the regret of never trying to push your boundaries.
- “You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” - John C. Maxwell
