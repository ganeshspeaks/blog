People usually remember evil of a person than positive side, because our brain is developed as we get alerted on an attack (here, attack doesn't only mean physical harm, but it also means, attack of opposite beliefs and thoughts), so whenever, someone does slagging, insult or any physical harm of us, our brain feels, it as an attack. We remember it more, so that we would not go there again.
