title: "Stithapragnya and the Brain: How Inner Peace Reflects Neural Integration"

Actually, I was watching a video from the *Gita Saar* (summary) in the Mahabharat serial. In that video, Krishna describes the nature of a *Stithapragnya* — a person of steady wisdom. He says that a Stithapragnya lives in constant peace. No matter how much chaos exists outside, he remains calm and composed. He sees, laughs, gets angry, and acts like others, but all the while, he stays aware of his true self — which is peace.

This really struck me. I started thinking about how the brain works — how different parts are engaged in different situations. For example, the **prefrontal cortex** is involved in decision-making and logical thinking, while the **posterior parietal cortex (PPC)** plays a role in attention and high-level processing. The **temporal lobes** are used in reading and language processing, and the **limbic system** manages emotions.

Each part has a specific role. So a person can only be truly creative, emotional, aware, and peaceful when **all parts of the brain are active and well-connected**.

From this, I concluded that the brain of a Stithapragnya must be incredibly integrated and powerful — because all regions are awake, balanced, and in harmony.

And I believe this state can be cultivated through deep **sadhana**, **bhakti**, and **other forms of yoga**.
