According to most people or philosophers, *"God is who has created the world, humans, and everything, and he is the most powerful and intelligent. Nothing is beyond the God. God is infinite"*.

I think, 'Universe' is very suitable to this definition. The Universe is created itself, the universe has created the world, humans and everything we can see, feel and observe. By universe, I don't mean 'only one universe'. I mean, everything also that is beyond our universe.

The Universe is God. No one and nothing can create it, it has created itself and will destroy itself. The Universe is most powerful, most intelligent and infinite. It's corporeal (Saakar) and formless (Niraakar) both at the same time. It's defined as well undefined.
We can understand, feel universe as well as we can't perceive universe. 
**THE GOD IS THE UNIVERSE.**
