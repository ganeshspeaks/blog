# Activity Itself Is a Result

There’s a deep truth I realized while reading the Bhagavad Gita —  
Krishna says:  
**"Do your duty, without thinking about the results."**

At first, this sounds strange.  
Why should I do something if I don’t get a result?

But then I understood —  
**The action itself *is* a result.**

---

### Example:

When you **plant a tree**, you don’t just wait for fruits.  
At that moment, your brain releases happy chemicals — dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.  
You feel good *right now*, just by doing something meaningful.

Now imagine you **hurt someone**, or get angry.  
Even before any "karma" happens outside, your brain releases stress chemicals — cortisol, tension, anxiety.

So actually, **every action is already giving a result inside you**, instantly.

### Modern Science + Gita Say the Same:

Krishna says:  
> "Focus only on your karma, not on the fruit."

Science says:  
> "Your thoughts and actions trigger real-time chemical changes in your body."

So whether you act with kindness, discipline, anger, or ego —  
**your brain and soul are reacting immediately.**

---

### Final Thought:

> **Your mind is the first place where karma happens.**  
> Sow love, peace, and discipline — and you’ll feel the result instantly.

Let’s stop chasing only outer rewards.  
Let’s start valuing the inner rewards — the calm, joy, focus, and energy that come *just from doing the right thing*.
