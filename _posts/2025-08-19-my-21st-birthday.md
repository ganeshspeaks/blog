Today's my birthday. I turned 21 years old. To be honest, it didn't feel like a special day,  it's just a normal (maybe worse) day as usual. I had expected to feel more energy and passion towards my goals and entering a new phase of my life.
But those feelings faded before they even came.
Anyways, I didn't give up. What coming in my mind is - 'NEVER GIVE UP'. I am not losing Hope, and I will get back tomorrow and will make tomorrow a great day.
I think, I should read book and reset my brain again.
And, I am grateful for making a mini project using Arduino Nano, LEDs, and a buzzer that played the birthday tone. It reminded me that even on quiet days, I can create my own joy. It was one of the best gifts I gave to myself.
This birthday may not have been perfect, but Iâ€™ll always remember it for the hope it carried and the spark I built with my own hands.
