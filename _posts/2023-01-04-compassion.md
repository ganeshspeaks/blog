# Compassion
'A full stomach means no harm',
A mother-bird was singing with charm.
But who has seen the future,
Something bad was happening in nature.

With time, a creature came,
And took their lives without a thought
He killed the chicks without any shame
And left the mother-bird distraught.

He has not empty stomach
Yet, he killed the birds.
He was a human,
He called himself superior,
But his actions were inferior.

Let us learn from this story
Not to kill animals for greed
Our compassion makes the world full of glory
Make love and kindness our deed.
