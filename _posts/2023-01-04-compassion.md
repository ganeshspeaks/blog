# Compassion

## A Lesson in Compassion  

> 'A full stomach means no harm',  
> A mother-bird was singing with charm.  
> But who has seen the future,  
> Something bad was happening in nature.  
>  <br/>
> With time, a creature came,  
> And took their lives without a thought.  
> He killed the chicks without any shame,  
> And left the mother-bird distraught.  
>  <br/>
> He has not an empty stomach,  
> Yet, he killed the birds.  
> He was a human,  
> He called himself superior,  
> But his actions were inferior.  
>  <br/>
> Let us learn from this story,  
> Not to kill animals for greed.  
> Our compassion makes the world full of glory,  
> Make love and kindness our deed.
