**From Today — 1 Book a Day**

From today, I commit to reading one book per day — no matter how much I retain.
I know I’m imperfect. I won’t remember everything. But that’s not the point.

Because I believe 300 unique ideas from 300 books
is far more powerful than 300 ideas repeated from just one.

Each day, one new idea. One new lens. One new upgrade.
I read to evolve — not to impress.

Let me not chase perfection, but choose progress, wisdom, and momentum.
Daily. Relentlessly.

Some days, I might only get through half a book or skim heavily. That’s fine, I will keep the streak alive and move forward.

Here's what I think about retention:- ideas have a way of surfacing when you need them. You might not remember the exact quote or which book it came from, but when you're facing a problem months later, some framework or concept you skimmed will suddenly click into place.

And I’m sure of one thing — if today I retain just 10%,
then by Day 100, my mind will retain far more, with deeper memory and sharper connections.
That's probably the most exciting part of this whole challenge - not just the books, but watching my own mind evolve in real time.

So here begins the journey:
**One book. Every day. For the rest of the year.**
