2025 was an amazing year. I learned and did many things. I read around 16 books, created my first IoT project, and met several people. I traveled to Lalpur Jungle, Damakol Waterfall, Dhanbad, Chaibasa, Darjeeling, Kolkata, Basukinath (bike trip with friends 😄) and other places. Darjeeling was my dream destination.

Even though I failed multiple times, I revised Study Friend based on user needs, which ultimately resulted in a strong product-market fit (PMF).
I learned a lot about personal growth, mindset, business, and spirituality. To portray the lesson of the year, I wrote this poem:

INSTRUMENT

> I worked in the dark
> Until my eyes began to strain.
> 
> I got defeated;
> as if it was written in my fate.
> 
> I stared at the sky
> thinking my fruits were late.
> 
> Then the candle got its fire
> I'm not the musician; but nature is.
> I'm not the player; but God is.
> 
> How could the flute play itself?
> How could the instrument judge itself?
