Build a successful product is harder than simply learning an advanced skill, because a product is very fragile, even a single mistake can cause it to fail.

Why am I even comparing both of them? Because I am on the position, where things aren't good or bad, but most of my options are good. Usually people compare with good vs bad. While I am comparing with good vs better (at a specific time).
I have to stop learning and start executing.
