**The Resilience Factor** – Karen Reivich & Andrew Shatte
Date - 17 August 2025

---

**Purpose**: Reason behind reading this book is simple: I want to be resilient in every situation, no matter how bad it is going on. I have noticed in myself that sometimes I talk and act emotionally, which I regret later. By reading this book, I want to address my emotional immaturity and the cluster of thoughts that trigger my emotions, leading to distraction. Through this book, I want to learn to handle adversity with clarity and strength.

### Key Ideas

1. **Resilience is a skill, not a trait** – Anyone can build resilience by practicing new ways of thinking and responding.
2. **Thinking traps weaken us** – Overgeneralization, catastrophizing, and blaming block rational thinking; resilience requires breaking these traps.
3. **Optimism with accuracy** – Realistic optimism helps us see challenges clearly while still believing in our ability to overcome them.
4. **ABCDE Model** – Adversity → Belief → Consequence → Disputation → Energization; a practical framework to stop destructive thought cycles.
5. **Control what you can** – Focus on controllable aspects of a situation, instead of wasting energy on what’s beyond your control.

### Memorable Quotes
> “Resilience is about how you recharge, not how you endure.”
<br/>
> “You are not your thoughts; you are the observer of your thoughts.”
<br/>
> “Adversity does not define you—your response to adversity does.”
<br/>

### Action Steps
- Practice the **ABCDE model** daily to challenge my automatic negative thoughts.
- Identify my personal “thinking traps” and replace them with rational alternatives.
- Build small resilience rituals (pause before reacting, journaling emotions, reframing problems).

**Reflection**: This book reminded me that resilience is not about suppressing emotions but about mastering my responses. It aligns with my goal of becoming mentally strong and steady, especially in tough times.
