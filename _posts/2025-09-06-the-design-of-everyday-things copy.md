**The Design of Everyday Things** – Don Norman
Date: 06 September -

---

**Purpose**: I am currently rebuilding Study Friend from scratch, so through this book, I want to dive deep into the principles of design and user experience. I want to learn, how to design and how to think as a designer, and how things around me will help me in designing.

### Key Ideas

1.

### Memorable Quotes
> “Resilience is about how you recharge, not how you endure.”

<br/>

> “You are not your thoughts; you are the observer of your thoughts.”

<br/>

> “Adversity does not define you—your response to adversity does.”

<br/>

### Action Steps
- Practice the **ABCDE model** daily to challenge my automatic negative thoughts.
- Identify my personal “thinking traps” and replace them with rational alternatives.
- Build small resilience rituals (pause before reacting, journaling emotions, reframing problems).

**Reflection**: This book reminded me that resilience is not about suppressing emotions but about mastering my responses. It aligns with my goal of becoming mentally strong and steady, especially in tough times.
