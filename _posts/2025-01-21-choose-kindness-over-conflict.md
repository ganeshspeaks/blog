We never truly know when someone else's journey or our own might come to an end. Life is unpredictable - death could come at any moment. We're unaware of instant death, whether during a drive, a walk, or through some natural disaster. There are millions of things which can kill our lives. This uncertainty teaches us to cherish the time we have and treat others with kindness. We often argue with friends, family on silly things.

Spending time peacefully with friends, parents, grandparents is better than hating just because of opposite mindset. It might happen that you can't see their faces tomorrow, so be kind to them. enjoy the moment over conflict. A kind word or a small act of compassion can bring peace to both ourselves and them.

When we approach others with empathy, we not only make their lives a little brighter but also cultivate inner peace for ourselves.

> Remember, life is beautiful, when we share love and kindness towards people. 

In the end, it's not the arguments that define us, but it's the love and kindness we show.

So, live each day with a kind heart. Forgive often, love deeply, and leave the world a little better than you found it.
