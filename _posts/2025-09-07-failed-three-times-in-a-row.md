**Failed three times in a row.**

1. First, I built an app with flashcards, mind maps, AI ask, quick facts feed → then realized most students use desktop.
2. Second, I built StudyFriend.me with flashcards, mind maps, study tracker, pomodoro → good signups, but zero retention.
3. Third, I rebuilt Study Friend with simpler UI/UX → 20% signup, but again, no retention, no premium.

Then I almost went into building sBook, sNote, social feed… but caught myself before wasting more time.

Now, I’m focusing on **Homework Helper** (mobile-first, targeting US, UK, Australia). Maybe I’ll fail again. Maybe I’ll feel stuck. But it doesn’t matter. I’ll take care of these failures until I become the kind of person who can create enormous wealth.

> Failures aren’t the end. They’re just training rounds.

### Insights

- Don't build the thing that feels fancy and emotional to you.
- People don't care how much effort you have put. They only care, what problems your product will solve.
- Execute fast to realize fast. Don't think, you have entire life to build, learn, and then give up.
