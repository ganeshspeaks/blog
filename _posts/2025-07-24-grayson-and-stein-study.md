**Movement** is a process, rather than a series of static positions. This is an extension and a reflection of emotions and thoughts, and not merely something which occurs sporadically as the result of external stimuli..

### **What the Study Found**

Grayson & Stein studied how attackers (like muggers) choose their victims. They **filmed pedestrians walking** and later showed the footage to convicted criminals. The criminals consistently picked certain individuals as "easy targets" **within 7 seconds** — based *not* on age, gender, or clothing, but on **non-verbal cues**.


### **Victim Cues Identified**

Attackers subconsciously look for these **vulnerability signals**:

1. **Gait (the way you walk)**

   * Uncoordinated, slow, shuffling, hesitant, or unbalanced movement signals weakness.
   * Strong, upright, deliberate stride suggests confidence and control.

2. **Posture**

   * Slouched shoulders, looking down, or trying to appear invisible → seen as weak.
   * Erect spine, open chest, natural arm swing → seen as self-assured.

3. **Awareness**

   * Distracted (on phone, zoned out, nervous) = easy prey.
   * Alert, observant = harder target.

4. **Eye Contact**

   * No eye contact or darting eyes = fear/nervousness.
   * Calm eye contact (not aggressive) = confidence.

### **How to Protect Yourself (Practically)**

You don’t need to be physically strong — just change your **non-verbal behavior**:

1. **Walk with Purpose** – Long strides, steady rhythm, firm steps.
2. **Fix Your Posture** – Head up, shoulders back, spine straight.
3. **Stay Aware** – Notice your environment. Avoid distractions (phones/music in risky areas).
4. **Radiate Calm Confidence** – Not aggressive, just aware and grounded.
5. **Make Brief Eye Contact** – A short, calm glance shows you’re alert and not fearful.
