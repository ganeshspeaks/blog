As a kid, I dreamed about having my own library, a physics lab, a computer setup, and a musical instrument. Now I actually have them: 30+ books on my shelf, electronic kits (Arduino, EPS) and sensors, a laptop & a 27-inch monitor, and a flute. Back then, I thought getting these things would make me incredibly happy. And honestly? I am. I feel satisfied and full of joy.

What I've achieved:
- [x] A library
- [x] A physics lab
- [x] A computer lab
- [x] A flute

Now I don't have big goals stressing me out. Just some necessities and dreams I want to explore.

**Necessities:**
- [ ] Building 3-4 steady income sources
- [ ] Getting fit and staying kind

**Dreams to explore:**
1. Planting 1000+ trees
2. Helping people
3. Building telescopes and stargazing
4. Traveling the world (oceans, jungles, different cultures)

I used to think I needed fame and millions to be happy. Now I realize I don't need $1M, just $1-2k a month. I don't need to build a unicorn, just a product making $1k MRR. I don't need 100 friends, just 4-5 good ones.

**My 2026 goals:**
1. Be kinder
2. Get 1% better daily at coding, writing, flute, math, and physics
3. Build muscle
4. Turn Study Friend into a steady income source ($1k MRR by year-end)
5. Take 1-2 freelance projects per month, not 4-5 per week
6. Spend more time with family and friends
7. Read fiction instead of business books, and write a fictional book

One thing that makes me happy is how simple life becomes when I focus on what I need instead of what I imagine. My parents feel the same way. I've realized they don't want me to be an IAS officer or chase some prestigious career. They just want to see me stand on my own feet, earn a living, and handle whatever life throws at me.
The person who inspired this shift is Dhananjay. His lessons genuinely changed my life, and I'm grateful to him. He told me two things I'll never forget:

> Life is beautiful for those who see beauty in it.  

 > You don't need to stress about fictional dreams, just follow what you actually need.
