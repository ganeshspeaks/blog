One thing I learned lately is: life is not all about grinding and aiming high all the time, we usually forget that life is not complex as we think and make it. This year I was aiming so high that I'd be richest man in my society making in several digits, etc. But i burned out soon. The reason: it was not my aim, but it was just ego trying to feed itself. When you aim, because everyone is aiming this, then there is a big chance that you will burn out soon, and will get dissappointed.

Therefore, before aiming something, ask what you actually need, is it just ego-feeding goal to achieve. Aiming for billions before making thousands to live peacefully is worst thing you can do with mental health. I don't say, aiming high is bad, but it's bad when it's totally influenced by society, and you just want to do it, because everyone will praise you. It becomes a poison when you aim because of people around you tells you to do it.
