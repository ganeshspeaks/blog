## Father's Day 

When I am with him,
I don’t feel like dim.
He doesn’t have super powers,
But he is a super hero.
I don’t feel like fear,
When I am with him.
He is my greatest support,
He is my biggest comfort.
He is bitter from outside,
But he is lovely enough by inside.
I know two things are infinite,
Numbers are infinite,
His sacrifices are infinite.
His love is extensive,
Time spent with him is expensive.
He is the only person,
He is my father.
Love you papa ❤️❤️
