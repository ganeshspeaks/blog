# Father's Day 

> When I am with him,  <br/>
> I don’t feel like dim. <br/>
> He doesn’t have super powers, <br/>
> But he is a super hero. <br/>
> I don’t feel like fear, <br/>
> When I am with him. <br/>
> He is my greatest support, <br/>
> He is my biggest comfort. <br/>
> He is bitter from outside, <br/>
> But he is lovely enough by inside. <br/>
> I know two things are infinite, <br/>
> Numbers are infinite, <br/>
> His sacrifices are infinite. <br/>
> His love is extensive, <br/>
> Time spent with him is expensive. <br/>
> He is the only person, <br/>
> He is my father. <br/>
> Love you papa ❤️❤️ <br/>
