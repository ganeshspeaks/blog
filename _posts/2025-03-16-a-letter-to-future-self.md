I feel like you've tried a lot of things so far. What’s the date today—maybe 2026, 2030, or 2050? I really can’t guess what you’re doing these days… um, let me guess—maybe something in technical skills, or maybe you’re still questioning philosophical stuff. Hehe! I don’t think you’re still stuck in those philosophical questions. Philosophy is good, but honestly, I feel like it’s just overthinking and kind of boring.

Besides philosophy, you’re experiencing things—failure, adventure, success, or PEAAACEEEE. Haha! Life is really full of things—sometimes learning, sometimes working, and even sometimes, doing nothing works out just fine.  

What I want in you (my future self) is:  
- You’re disciplined.  
- You’re happy.  
- You’re doing what you love, or you love what you do. Both are right.  

By the way, can I give you some *gyaan*? Okay, you’re not egoistic, so you’ll listen to me.  

Bro, see—I know you’ve had tough moments, but remember—you’ve always found a way through. Life is really amazing, and sometimes sorrowful too. You can’t control everything, and you shouldn’t even try. Focus on the positive things, don’t regret, and I don’t expect you to fulfill all my dreams from today. What I really want is for you to accept yourself and love your life.  

.........................................................................................  

These dots—signs of my negative thoughts (losing my loved ones, being more depressed than now, or maybe something else). But don’t worry, brother. I love you.

You are the simplest creature on Earth, in a tiny solar system, inside a beautiful galaxy. You don’t have to worry about everything you can’t control.
 
No matter what happens, you’re still you—and that’s always enough. 
**Love yourself. Be happy. I don’t expect anything from you. You tried whatever you were capable of.**
