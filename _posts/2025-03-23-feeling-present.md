title: "Feeling Present: A New Experience with Mantra and Dharana"
tags: ["experience"]
---

These days, I've started chanting a Vedic mantra focused on wisdom and presence. Yesterday, while practicing **Dharana** (focused concentration), I experienced something unique—something I had never felt before.  

For a moment, I felt deeply present. My thoughts were fewer, lighter, and less tense. It was as if my mind’s energy, which usually flows into scattered thoughts, had settled into the **now**.  

To describe it simply:  
- **Before**, my awareness was often caught up in endless thoughts, pulling me away from the present. I feel it most of the time in my daily life (except deep working).

- **Yesterday**, for the first time, I felt my mind resting in the moment—aware, focused, and fully engaged with whatever I was looking at.

It was an amazing experience, one that I hope to deepen with continued **mantra practice and yoga**.
