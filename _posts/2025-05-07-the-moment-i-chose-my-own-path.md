In classes 9 and 10, I used to read biographies of scientists, mathematicians, and many others. I watched the movie *Super 30*, and came across many stories that deeply impacted me — stories that made me decide to **never rely on any government or private organization/system**.

I once dreamed of becoming a rocket scientist, exploring space, and building telescopes. But the struggles and sacrifices in the lives of those scientists and mathematicians shook me from within.

That’s why I started exploring things on my own — entrepreneurship, skill development, and much more.

In fact, I’m learning technical skills like coding and Arduino by myself.
I’m building a tech startup to fund my future dreams —
because dreams like mine require both **a huge amount of money** and **strong technical skills**.

I stopped relying on government colleges or organizations after completing class 10.
