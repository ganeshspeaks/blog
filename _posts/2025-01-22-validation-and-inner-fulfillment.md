title: "Gap Between Validation and Inner Fulfillment"

Today, I observed that I often share my poems and philosophical thoughts with people. I tried to understand the reason behind it and identified two major factors that drive humans to share their thoughts and photos with others: 1. Social Connection and 2. Validation.

**Social Connection** is the primary factor. As social beings, we feel the need to fit into a community. To determine whether we are accepted or valued by society, we often share our art or photos to seek **validation** from others.

Building connections with people isn’t inherently bad, but it becomes harmful when we rely solely on their approval instead of enjoying our own creativity.

It’s possible that others may not like or acknowledge our creativity, which could lead to feelings of disappointment or discouragement.

In conclusion, connect with people, but don’t depend on their validation for inner fulfillment. True inner fulfillment and happiness come from within, not from external sources. So, enjoy writing, reading books, capturing photos, or whatever you love to do, for the joy it brings to you.
