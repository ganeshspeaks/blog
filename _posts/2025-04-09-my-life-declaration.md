I have one life. Just one.
I don’t know what came before birth, or what will come after death.
But in this short breath of time—I want to be free.”

Free to see the world—not just the maps, but the hidden places:
The jungles, the oceans, the mountains, and even the stars above.

I want to explore:
- History, to feel the pulse of the past.
- Futures, to imagine what’s possible.
- Spirituality, to find the soul beneath it all.
- Technology, to create new realities.

I want to see the world through every eye:
- The eye of a student, who questions everything.
- The eye of a monk, who has nothing yet everything.
- The eye of a psychopath, to see darkness without fear.
- The eye of a depressed soul, to feel the weight of pain.
- The eye of a bad guy, to understand choice and consequence.
- The eye of the happiest man, who laughs freely.
- The eye of the failed one, who still stands up.
- The eye of the explorer, who is never satisfied.

I want to live a thousand lifetimes in this one.
Not through rebirth—but through intense, conscious living.
I will love. I will lose. I will break. I will heal.
I will code my world, chant my truth, and walk with fire in my soul.

When death comes, let it find me exhausted but full—
with no dream untried, no truth unasked, no love unfelt.

I came not to obey life.
I came to dance with it.
