**Think Straight** â€“ Darius Foroux
Date: 02 August
<br/>

**Purpose**: Throught this book, I want to learn the concepts and hacks to give direction to my thoughts, from chaos to straight and practical thoughts. And I want to avoid non-stop useless thoughts.

### Key Ideas

1. You cannot stop thoughts, but you can control and decide what to think. Controlling your thoughts require training (meditation, mindfulness).
2. Avoid making decisions based on beliefs, obvious logic and even science. Because scientists are also human beings. That means they have their cognitive biases (thinking system errors such as confirmation bias).
3. The quality of your thoughts determines the quality of your lives. And your decisions are a result of your thoughts. Most of your thoughts are just useless, so filter them regularly:
  - Write down your thoughts and decide what are worthy and not.
  - Think only about solving a problem or understanding knowledge.
  - Think about what you can control.
  - Improve the quality of your thoughts, so you improve the quality of your actions.

### Memorable Quotes

> "You should question the source of your beliefs, not the belief itself. Because most of your beliefs are based on your or other people's perception."

<br/>

> "Conquer yourself rather than the world." - Rene Descartes

<br/>

> "You don't regret what you did in life, you regret what you didn't do."
<br/>

### Action Steps

- I will decide what to think. It's true that I have very less things to think about, such as thinking about what I can control, solving my problem, understanding concepts. That's all.
- I will try to avoid thinking about those things: what I cannot control, fantasies, daydreaming, thinking about future and past, comparing with others, thinking about what people think about me, sharing knowledge and making assumption about people's mindset, etc.
- I should understand that life is too limited, I should carefully select things to do and think.

**Reflection**: This book reminded me about I can decide what to think, and I must do it, because quality of my thoughts determine my action and destiny.
