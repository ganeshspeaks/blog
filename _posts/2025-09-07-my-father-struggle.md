Today I saw my fatherâ€™s day. Morning 5 to 9 in the farm, then straight to mistri work, came home at 6:30 PM, ate quickly, and again went back to work. My heart broke watching him ðŸ˜­. He doesnâ€™t complain, he just keeps moving, carrying this family on his shoulders.

<br/>

And here I am, 21 years old, sitting with my laptop, dreaming of creating wealth. Sometimes I call myself stupid, but deep inside I know, this is my path. He is fighting with his hands, and I am fighting with my mind. One day, my struggle will give him rest. One day, he wonâ€™t have to leave home at 5 AM anymore.

<br/>

Until then, Iâ€™ll hold this guilt not as a burden but as fire. Fire to make sure all this sacrifice will not be wasted.
