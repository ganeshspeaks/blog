**Who am I?**  

Honestly, this is one of the toughest questions I’ve ever thought about. If you ask me, “Who am I?” in a general sense, I’d say:  
I’m **Ganesh Kumar**—a passionate learner who spends time reading books, writing lines of code, crafting poetry, and occasionally drawing. I also love dancing (in my private space, especially in the bathroom) and talking to myself. Besides that, I enjoy adventure, exploring jungles, and making new friends.  

Philosophically, I’ve pondered this question many times, but I still don’t have a definite answer. If you’ve figured out the answer for yourself, congratulations—you’ve nailed it!  

**Something ‘boring’ about me**  
I work hard—really hard. I rarely go to parties or attend functions, and I don’t talk much on a daily basis. However, I do take breaks to celebrate or unwind, but only occasionally, after pushing myself to the limit with work. Some people say my life is boring, but for me, solving unexpected coding errors and diving deep into my passions is what truly excites me.
