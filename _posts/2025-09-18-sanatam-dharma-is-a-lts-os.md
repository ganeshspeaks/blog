I had this thought the other day: *“According to Hinduism, Atma lives in the body. But is Atma = Paramatma?”*

At first glance, it feels confusing. If **Atma = Paramatma**, then what about the body? Doesn’t Paramatma have to be beyond just the soul?

Here’s what Sanātan Dharma (Hindu philosophy) explains:

* **Ātma (soul)** is eternal, divine, not the body.
* **Paramātma (Supreme Soul)** is the source of both **Ātma (consciousness)** and **Prakṛti (nature, matter, body)**.
* Gītā says: body is *aparā prakṛti* (lower energy), soul is *parā prakṛti* (higher energy). Together, they form life.
* So my body **and** my soul are both from Paramātma.
* People focus on the soul because the body is temporary, while the soul is eternal.

That means Paramātma isn’t *just* the soul. He is the **ocean from which both soul and matter flow**, and the **power that governs them**.

And here’s the beautiful part…

Sanātan Dharma feels like an **open-source OS of spirituality**.

* Over thousands of years, sages debated, meditated, and patched every “bug” (unanswered question).
* If you ask, “Who made the body? What is soul? Why suffering? What is ultimate reality?” — there’s always an answer.
* Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism? They’re like forks of this OS, but the **core kernel (Sanātan truths)** remains unbreakable.

In short: Sanātan Dharma is the **bug-free cosmic OS**, tested for yugas. 🕉️✨
